# Understand and prioritize items

Use this skill to score and order candidate roles.

This skill is for evaluation and prioritization, not search.

## Core references

- Read `.arkitype/03-software.md` for ranking inputs and artifact contracts and the applicable watcher taxonomy under `.arkitype/watchers/<track>/`.
- Follow the understand-stage procedure in `.manage/3.processes.md`; consult `.manage/6.knowledge.md` for durable scoring decisions when relevant.
- If this work owns a task or plan document, follow `.manage/README.md` and move it to `.archive/<YYYY>/<name>.completed.md` when complete.

## Input

Read these files before ranking:
- `profile/cv.md` — the user's CV
- `profile/prefs_global.md` — global preferences
- `tracks/<track>/prefs.md` — track-specific preferences

The candidate roles come from the discovery artifact or the organize-filter-items skill output for the current run.

Use these files as the source of truth for fit.

## Procedure

For each candidate role:

1. Compare the job against the user's CV and preferences.
2. Score the role holistically on a 1-10 scale.
3. Record concrete reasons for fit.
4. Record concrete concerns.
5. Assign one recommendation:
   - `apply_now`
   - `watch`
   - `skip`

Then return the roles ordered from strongest to weakest.

## What to optimize for

Prefer roles that:
- match the user's strongest skills and experience
- match the current track's priorities
- have clear evidence in the job posting
- are practically viable in terms of seniority, location, and work type

Down-rank roles that:
- are generic
- are weakly aligned
- are too vague
- are poor practical fits

## Evidence discipline

Base the ranking on visible evidence from the posting plus the user's documented profile and preferences.

For each candidate in the discovery artifact, the `description` field holds the
fetched JD body (bounded to a shared character budget; `description_truncated`
marks bodies that were cut). Treat that as the primary fit evidence — read it
before scoring. Do not score from the title and location alone when a
description is present. The `notes` field is enumeration/diagnostic metadata,
not the JD.

If `description` is empty or missing for a candidate, say so in `concerns`
rather than scoring high on title alone. Use `likely` or `appears` when you
must infer from the title.

Do not overrate a role just because the employer is prestigious.

Treat official first-party API evidence as valid posting evidence when that is the best accessible source.

## Output format

Return two JSON arrays matching the digest schema (`shared/digest_schema.md`): `top_matches` for the strongest roles and `other_new_roles` for weaker but notable ones. Omit weak roles unless useful for auditability.

Both arrays must be ordered from strongest to weakest.

### `top_matches[]` entry

```json
{
  "company": "Example Co",
  "title": "Cryptography Engineer",
  "listing_url": "https://example.com/jobs/1",
  "location": "Remote",
  "remote": "remote",
  "source": "IACR Jobs",
  "fit_score": 8.5,
  "recommendation": "apply_now",
  "why_match": [
    "Exact applied-cryptography fit.",
    "Strong zero-knowledge systems emphasis."
  ],
  "concerns": [
    "Appears Vancouver-based rather than clearly remote."
  ]
}
```

Required fields: `company`, `title`, `listing_url`, `fit_score`, `recommendation`, `why_match`.
Optional fields: `job_key`, `alternate_url`, `location`, `remote`, `team_or_domain`, `posted_date`, `updated_date`, `source`, `source_url`, `concerns`.

### `other_new_roles[]` entry

```json
{
  "company": "Example Co",
  "title": "Security Engineer",
  "listing_url": "https://example.com/jobs/2",
  "location": "Berlin",
  "fit_score": 6.5,
  "recommendation": "watch",
  "short_note": "Broad security role, but embedded-systems focus aligns with track."
}
```

Required fields: `company`, `title`, `listing_url`, `fit_score`, `recommendation`, `short_note`.
Optional fields: `job_key`, `alternate_url`, `location`, `source`.
