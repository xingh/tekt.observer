# Machine Setup

## Local application

The shortest path to the user interface is:

```bash
bash scripts/bootstrap_venv.sh --no-chromium
./tekt.observer up
```

Open `http://127.0.0.1:8091`. The first run uses npm to install and build the React frontend if necessary, then seeds the immutable JSON store under `state/`. Later launches reuse both. Override storage with `TEKT_OBSERVER_STORE`; tune snapshot compaction with `TEKT_OBSERVER_COMPACT_EVERY` and `TEKT_OBSERVER_COMPACT_SECONDS`. The app server refuses non-loopback bindings.

For first-time setup, choose the automation agent explicitly after cloning the repo:

```bash
bash scripts/bootstrap_machine.sh --agent claude
# or
bash scripts/bootstrap_machine.sh --agent codex
# or
bash scripts/bootstrap_machine.sh --agent gemini
```

That will:

- create machine-local config via `scripts/setup_machine.sh`
- create local profile placeholders under `profile/`
- bootstrap the repo-local virtualenv via `scripts/bootstrap_venv.sh`
- print a final next-step block with the guided setup command

In an interactive terminal, bootstrap asks whether to launch the guided setup agent now; the default answer is yes. In non-interactive mode, it never launches the agent unless you pass `--start-setup-agent`. Use `--no-start-setup-agent` to suppress the prompt in interactive runs.

You can also launch guided setup directly after bootstrap:

```bash
bash scripts/start_setup_agent.sh --agent claude
# or
bash scripts/start_setup_agent.sh --agent codex
# or
bash scripts/start_setup_agent.sh --agent gemini
```

For Claude interactive setup, treat the workspace trust dialog as a real CLI constraint. `scripts/start_setup_agent.sh --agent claude` still scopes tools and appends the setup contract, but if Claude shows a trust prompt before the setup flow starts:

1. trust the folder
2. rerun `bash scripts/start_setup_agent.sh --agent claude`
3. if Claude still opens without the guided setup contract, paste this fallback prompt:

```text
Use the project skill $explore-start for a guided first-track setup in this repo.

Default behavior:
- Propose recommended answers for missing profile and track preferences; let me override them.
- If the source list is sparse, use $explore-discover-sources as the recommended next step.
- After discovery, apply the recommended keep/drop/cadence/filter defaults unless I object.
- Continue automatically through canaries, probing, scaffolding, validation, and the first local digest preview.
- Do not move on to email or scheduling before the first digest preview.
```

If you only need to refresh the generated machine-local config later, run `bash scripts/setup_machine.sh --agent claude`, `bash scripts/setup_machine.sh --agent codex`, or `bash scripts/setup_machine.sh --agent gemini` directly. Existing `.env.local` files can also supply the previous `JOB_AGENT_PROVIDER`. That creates:

- `.env.local` for machine-local paths and binaries
- `.codex/config.toml` when the provider is Codex
- `.schedule.local` for local scheduled jobs
- `.scheduler/` for generated cron and launchd artifacts
- `.scheduler/bwrap-userns-restrict` on Linux when the provider is Codex and `bwrap` is on `PATH`
- `profile/cv.md` and `profile/prefs_global.md` if they do not already exist

The `profile/` directory is local user data and is ignored by Git. `profile/cv.md` is the primary agent-readable CV context. `profile/prefs_global.md` stores durable cross-track preferences. You can also place a PDF CV in `profile/`; the setup agent can use it to draft `profile/cv.md` when the Markdown CV is still the default placeholder.

Do not edit `shared/templates/profile/*`. Those files are tracked defaults used only when local profile files are missing.

In a normal terminal, the setup script prompts for missing machine-local values after the agent is selected.

### Automation Provider Configuration

When `scripts/setup_machine.sh` is run with `--agent claude`, it merges a repo-local `SessionStart` hook into `.claude/settings.local.json` that exports `CLAUDE_SESSION_ID`. The `engineering` skill reads this variable to record a resumable `agent_id` in plan files. This merge is idempotent and preserves any existing permissions or settings.

When `scripts/setup_machine.sh` is run with `--agent codex`, it writes a repo-local `.codex/config.toml` with a managed `shell_environment_policy` that puts the checkout's `./.venv/bin` first on `PATH`. This ensures that Codex shell commands use the project's virtualenv. If an existing unmanaged `shell_environment_policy` is present, setup reports a conflict and leaves it unchanged.

### Basic Options
- `JOB_AGENT_PROVIDER` stores that selected provider in `.env.local`.
- `JOB_AGENT_BIN` is required. If the selected provider binary is already on `PATH`, the script offers that detected binary as the default.
- `LOGSEQ_GRAPH_DIR` is optional. Bootstrap does not ask for delivery preferences; Logseq is configured later during guided delivery setup.
- SMTP settings are optional. Bootstrap does not ask for delivery preferences; the setup agent prompts for these during guided delivery setup and writes them to `.env.local` automatically. `JOB_AGENT_SECRETS_FILE` is also enabled by default for real secrets stored outside the repo. Prefer `JOB_AGENT_SMTP_PASSWORD_CMD`; if you need a static password, keep it in the external secrets file instead of `.env.local`.

On Linux, the setup script canonicalizes an auto-detected `codex` path via `readlink -f` before writing `JOB_AGENT_BIN`. This helps scheduled runs use the real executable path when host policies such as AppArmor are tied to that path. On macOS, setup keeps the detected path as-is. Claude and Gemini paths are written as detected.

For Codex, the setup script also writes `.codex/config.toml` with a managed `shell_environment_policy` that puts this checkout's `.venv/bin` first on `PATH`. This keeps Codex shell commands and patch helpers on the repo-local Python while preserving the rest of the setup-time PATH. If an existing unmanaged `shell_environment_policy` is present, setup leaves it unchanged and reports a conflict instead of overwriting local Codex preferences.

On Linux with `JOB_AGENT_PROVIDER=codex`, if `bwrap` is available on `PATH`, the setup script also writes `.scheduler/bwrap-userns-restrict`, a minimal AppArmor profile that grants `userns create` to the detected `bwrap` binary. This is meant for hosts that enforce AppArmor restrictions on unprivileged user namespaces. Claude and Gemini setups do not generate Codex/bwrap AppArmor guidance.

To install and reload that generated profile on Linux, run:

```bash
sudo bash scripts/install_bwrap_apparmor.sh
```

The installer copies the generated profile into `/etc/apparmor.d/bwrap-userns-restrict` and reloads it with `apparmor_parser -r`.

In non-interactive mode, the script does not prompt. `JOB_AGENT_BIN` must already be supplied via `--agent-bin`, the environment, existing `.env.local`, or the selected provider binary must be on `PATH`.

Provider examples:

```bash
bash scripts/setup_machine.sh --agent codex --agent-bin /absolute/path/to/codex
bash scripts/setup_machine.sh --agent claude --agent-bin /absolute/path/to/claude
bash scripts/setup_machine.sh --agent gemini --agent-bin /absolute/path/to/gemini
```

For Claude Code, authenticate locally before scheduled runs:

```bash
claude -p 'Respond with exactly: ok'
```

If that command reports `Not logged in`, run Claude Code login in an interactive terminal first. Scheduled Claude automation uses noninteractive `claude -p` with scoped allowed tools and normal project context loading; it does not use `--bare` by default.

For Gemini CLI, authenticate locally before scheduled runs:

```bash
gemini -p 'Respond with exactly: ok'
```

Scheduled Gemini automation uses headless mode from stdin with `--output-format stream-json`, `--approval-mode yolo`, and `--skip-trust`. Because Gemini enables sandboxing by default for `yolo`, jobwatch sets `GEMINI_SANDBOX=false` for scheduled and source-integration Gemini child processes unless you override `JOB_AGENT_GEMINI_SANDBOX` or `GEMINI_SANDBOX`. You can also override approval behavior with `JOB_AGENT_GEMINI_APPROVAL_MODE`, `JOB_AGENT_GEMINI_SCHEDULED_APPROVAL_MODE`, `JOB_AGENT_GEMINI_CODER_APPROVAL_MODE`, or `JOB_AGENT_GEMINI_SETUP_APPROVAL_MODE`.

The track setup agent normally asks about delivery and scheduling after it creates a track. When you choose scheduled runs, it writes `.schedule.local` with `scripts/configure_schedule.py` and installs the platform scheduler with `bash scripts/install_scheduler.sh`.

Track setup creates track-specific preferences in `tracks/<track>/prefs.md`. Those preferences are separate from `profile/prefs_global.md` and can override global preferences for that track.

During first-track setup, the guided agent:

- fills or defers `profile/cv.md` and `profile/prefs_global.md`
- collects the minimum track brief before source discovery, but proposes recommended answers instead of waiting for the user to invent each field
- proposes a starter source list, cadence defaults, and track-wide terms instead of making the user start from a blank sheet
- treats `explore-discover-sources` as the recommended next step when the source list is sparse and keeps its summary concise
- applies recommended keep/drop/cadence/filter defaults after source discovery unless the user overrides them
- probes accepted sources with `scripts/probe_career_source.py` where useful
- stores canaries and mutable integration state in `tracks/<track>/source_state.json`
- runs source-quality checks and treats a source as ready only when `eval_source_quality.py` reports `final_status: "pass"`
- may start detached source-integration jobs with `scripts/start_source_integration.py`, then queues the rest for one-at-a-time follow-up with `scripts/integrate_next_source.py`; `scripts/source_integration.py` is the heavier repo-development loop used by that follow-up path when code is needed
- runs the first local digest before email dry-run testing

If a canary disappears later, refresh it instead of deleting quality checks:

```bash
./.venv/bin/python scripts/update_source_canary.py --track <track> --source "<Source Name>"
```

For manual maintenance, use the helper instead of editing `.schedule.local` by hand:

```bash
./.venv/bin/python scripts/configure_schedule.py --track core_crypto --cadence daily --time 08:00
./.venv/bin/python scripts/configure_schedule.py --track core_crypto --cadence weekly --weekday mon --time 08:00 --delivery logseq
./.venv/bin/python scripts/configure_schedule.py --track core_crypto --cadence monthly --month-day 1 --time 08:00 --delivery email
./.venv/bin/python scripts/configure_schedule.py --track core_crypto --cadence weekly --weekday fri --time 18:00 --delivery telegram
```

Supported schedule file forms are:

```text
daily HH:MM track <track-slug> [--delivery logseq|email|telegram]...
weekly mon HH:MM track <track-slug> [--delivery logseq|email|telegram]...
monthly 1 HH:MM track <track-slug> [--delivery logseq|email|telegram]...
```

After changing schedules manually with the helper, install or refresh the platform scheduler with `bash scripts/install_scheduler.sh`.

- On Linux, that updates your user crontab with one checkout-specific entry that runs `scripts/run_scheduled_jobs.sh` every minute.
- On macOS, that installs a checkout-specific LaunchAgent that runs the same shared scheduler script every minute.

A scheduled entry becomes due on the first tick at or after its scheduled time on its scheduled day, and runs at most once on that day. This catch-up window matters on laptops: macOS suspends the LaunchAgent timer during sleep and fires a single coalesced tick on wake, so a job whose minute was slept through still runs once the machine wakes that same day. If the machine stays asleep for the entire scheduled day, that occurrence is missed.

Logseq sync is optional. Set `LOGSEQ_GRAPH_DIR` in `.env.local` only if you want digest publication into a Logseq graph.

Telegram delivery is optional. Keep `JOB_AGENT_TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID` in `.env.local`, and keep the bot token outside the repo. Prefer `JOB_AGENT_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN_CMD`; if you need a static token, keep `export JOB_AGENT_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=...` in `JOB_AGENT_SECRETS_FILE` instead of `.env.local`.

Telegram setup sequence:

```bash
bash scripts/run_track.sh --track <track>
test -f artifacts/digests/<track>/YYYY-MM-DD.json
./.venv/bin/python scripts/send_digest_telegram.py --track <track> --date YYYY-MM-DD --dry-run
```

Only test a real Telegram send or schedule Telegram delivery after the digest exists and the dry run renders correctly.

Email delivery is optional. The setup agent flow will prompt for non-secret email settings and write them to `.env.local` automatically. Keep any real app password or SMTP token outside the repo. Do not put SMTP passwords in tracked files, `.env.local`, or chat transcripts.

For common providers, start with the provider/account shorthand and then add recipients plus password retrieval:

```bash
export JOB_AGENT_EMAIL_PROVIDER=gmail
export JOB_AGENT_EMAIL_ACCOUNT=jobs@example.com
export JOB_AGENT_SMTP_TO=you@example.com
export JOB_AGENT_SMTP_PASSWORD_CMD='pass show email/jobwatch-smtp'
```

`JOB_AGENT_EMAIL_PROVIDER` currently supplies host/port/tls defaults for `gmail`, `fastmail`, `hotmail` / `outlook`, and Proton business SMTP. `JOB_AGENT_EMAIL_ACCOUNT` defaults the sender address and, for provider-backed setups, the SMTP username. Explicit `JOB_AGENT_SMTP_*` values still win when you need to override those defaults.

Keep only the retrieval wiring in `.env.local`. The real secret belongs either in the password manager entry read by `JOB_AGENT_SMTP_PASSWORD_CMD` or, if you need a static secret, in the external shell snippet named by `JOB_AGENT_SECRETS_FILE` as `export JOB_AGENT_SMTP_PASSWORD=...`.

Provider-specific setup notes:

- Gmail: `JOB_AGENT_EMAIL_PROVIDER=gmail` fills `smtp.gmail.com`, port `587`, and `STARTTLS`. Turn on Google 2-Step Verification, create a Google app password, and store that app password outside the repo. Put the retrieval command in `.env.local` via `JOB_AGENT_SMTP_PASSWORD_CMD`, or keep `export JOB_AGENT_SMTP_PASSWORD=...` in `JOB_AGENT_SECRETS_FILE`.
- Fastmail: `JOB_AGENT_EMAIL_PROVIDER=fastmail` fills `smtp.fastmail.com`, port `587`, and `STARTTLS`. Fastmail requires an app password for third-party SMTP clients, and Fastmail Basic plans do not include SMTP or app-password support. Store the app password outside the repo and wire it in through `JOB_AGENT_SMTP_PASSWORD_CMD` or `JOB_AGENT_SECRETS_FILE`.
- Outlook.com / Hotmail: `JOB_AGENT_EMAIL_PROVIDER=outlook` or `hotmail` fills `smtp-mail.outlook.com`, port `587`, and `STARTTLS`. Microsoft documents Modern Auth / OAuth2 as the preferred authentication method, so use this preset only if your account has a working app password or SMTP credential for SMTP AUTH. Store that secret outside the repo and expose it through `JOB_AGENT_SMTP_PASSWORD_CMD` or `JOB_AGENT_SECRETS_FILE`.

`JOB_AGENT_EMAIL_PROVIDER=proton` now means Proton business SMTP, not Proton Mail Bridge. Use it only with a Proton-generated SMTP token and a custom-domain address in `JOB_AGENT_EMAIL_ACCOUNT`. Proton’s documented business SMTP settings are `smtp.protonmail.ch`, port `587`, `STARTTLS`, and SMTP-token auth.

Normal personal Proton Mail via Proton Mail Bridge is still out of scope for the preset path. If you ever wire Bridge manually, keep its local host/port/username/TLS details explicit in `JOB_AGENT_SMTP_*` instead of using the provider shorthand.

Optional external secrets pointer in `.env.local`:

```bash
# Linux default path:
export JOB_AGENT_SECRETS_FILE=${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-$HOME/.config}/jobwatch/secrets.sh

# macOS default path:
export JOB_AGENT_SECRETS_FILE=$HOME/Library/Application\ Support/jobwatch/secrets.sh
```

When `JOB_AGENT_SECRETS_FILE` is not already set, setup automatically enables the platform-specific default path above and creates the parent directory and file if they are absent. This provides a clear, guaranteed location for `secrets.sh` where you can append credentials.

Preferred password retrieval examples:

```bash
export JOB_AGENT_SMTP_PASSWORD_CMD='security find-generic-password -s jobwatch-smtp -a jobs@example.com -w'
export JOB_AGENT_SMTP_PASSWORD_CMD='secret-tool lookup service jobwatch-smtp account jobs@example.com'
export JOB_AGENT_SMTP_PASSWORD_CMD='pass show email/jobwatch-smtp'
```

If you prefer a static password over `JOB_AGENT_SMTP_PASSWORD_CMD`, put it in the external file named by `JOB_AGENT_SECRETS_FILE`:

```bash
export JOB_AGENT_SMTP_PASSWORD=app-password
```

Plaintext repo-local `JOB_AGENT_SMTP_PASSWORD` in `.env.local` is no longer supported. `JOB_AGENT_SMTP_PASSWORD_CMD` is executed only for real sends, not for `--dry-run`.

Email setup sequence:

```bash
bash scripts/run_track.sh --track <track>
test -f artifacts/digests/<track>/YYYY-MM-DD.json
./.venv/bin/python scripts/send_digest_email.py --track <track> --date YYYY-MM-DD --dry-run
```

Only test a real send or schedule email delivery after the digest exists and the dry run renders correctly.
